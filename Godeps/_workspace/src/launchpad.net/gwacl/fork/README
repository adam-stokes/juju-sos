This directory contains a fork of Go's standard libraries net/http and
crypto/tls.

This fork is required to support the TLS renegociation which is triggered by
the Windows Azure Server when establishing an https connexion.  TLS
renegociation is currently not supported by Go's standard library.

The fork is based on go version 2:1.0.2-2.
The library crypto/tls is patched to support TLS renegociation (see the patch
file "go-tls-renegotiation.patch").
The library net/http is patched to use the forked version of crypto/tls.
